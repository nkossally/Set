# Set
Set is a JavaScript implementation of the card game Set. 

# Tech
Set is written with vanilla JavaScript, uses Canvas for rendering images and uses WebPack for bundling files.

# Gameplay
The object of each round of Set is to find a ‘set’ of three cards from the available face up cards. Each card has four 
features (color, symbol, number and shading). In a proper ‘set,’ for each feature, all three cards have the same variation 
of the feature, or different variations of the  feature. The variations of each feature are as follows:

1. Color: red, green, or blue.
2. Symbol: ovals, rectangles, or diamonds.
3. Number: one, two, or three symbols.
4. Shading: solid, open, or striped.

The game ends when you find ten sets.
